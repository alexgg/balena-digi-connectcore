meta-resin:

* The hostapp-update-hooks package contains a 99-resin-uboot and 99-resin-grub scripts that assumes block devices
* The balena-rollback package contains a rollback-parse-bootloader script that assumes block devices
* Need to default to overlay2, now it is done in the local.conf with:
	BALENA_STORAGE = "overlay2"
* Need to move the initialization of state and data to the initramfs
* Need to initialize rootB too
* Need to symlink the hostapp-ubifs image in the deploy folder, maybe rename the extension
